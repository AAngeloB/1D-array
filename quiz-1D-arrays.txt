1. Construct the contents of the array as a completed word in a variable called "word1" and call the function to print the contents.

var array1 = ["H", "a", "p", "p", "y"];

2. Consider the following code segment.

var array2 = [true, 0,  , 4, "who", "is", ];

console.log(array2.length);

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

3. What array method supplements a for loop?

4. Consider the following code segment.

var array3 = [4, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6];

array3.pop();
array3.push(6);
array3.pop();
array3.pop();
array3.sort();

console.log(array3);
console.log(array3.length);

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

5. What is the index that contains the value 0 in the previous array?
